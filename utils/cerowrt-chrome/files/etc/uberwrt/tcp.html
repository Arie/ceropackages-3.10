<h1>TCP, Traffic Shaping, and Network simulation</h1>
<h2 id="ECN">ECN enablement</h2>
<p> ECN - Explicit congestion notification - is enabled by
default. Connections shaped by an ECN enabled shaper will mark, rather
than drop, ECN enabled packets. This should improve (theoretically)
overall TCP performance and fairness in ways that normal packet drop
cannot. </p>

<p>We are encouraging more people to enable ECN throughout their
networks, on their hosts, and servers. By early 2011, ECN was enabled
on approximately 12% of all the servers in the web top 100, but it is
enabled on relatively few desktops, clients, and handheld devices.</p>

<p>Another means by which ECN enablement can help, is that by using
the <a href="proxy.html">web proxy</a> server, both sides of the
connection may be able to negotiate an ECN or non-ECN connection
separately.</p>

<p>Connections originating from the router have ECN enabled by
default. If you experience problems making connections to your router
for maintenance or other purposes, you may have a problem with ECN,
and you can easily turn it on or off, to diagnose it, from the network
parameters menu. The problem more likely lies with your
client! 
</p>

<p>Bufferbloat.net is very interested in reports of ECN success or
failures with given pieces of network equipment. We have high hopes
that ECN can be more widely deployed.</p>
<h2 id="sack">SACK/DSACK enablement</h2>
<p>TCP DSACK and SACK are enabled by default. These are optimizations
that improve TCP's behavior when losses are encountered. (They only
apply for connections originating from, not going through, the
router)</p>
<p> In practice, enabling these seem to cause no harm in the general
case, so long as smaller TCP windows are used.</p>
<h2 id="tcp">Alternate TCP algorithms</h2>
<p>The default TCP algorithm in this router is "Westwood+", which has
been shown to work better than Vegas, over wired and wireless
links. Available as options are Vegas, Reno, Cubic, and Bic - the last
two are the algorithms in most common use in the Linux world
today.</p>

<p>Changing the default TCP algorithm on the router has <i>no effect
on performance</i> unless you are using the
bundled <a href="proxy.html">web proxy</a>, or doing significant
amounts of traffic to/from the local <a href="rsync.html">rsync</a>
or <a href="webserver.html">web server</a>.</p>

<p>Packets going <i>through</i> the router use their own algorithms
from the host and servers involved.</p>

<p>Changing the default TCP algorithm, however, can be very useful for
simulating normal traffic during simulations. At some point in the
near future we hope to have a bandwidth and latency under load test
that more accurately measures the available bandwidth between the
router and the rest of the Internet. We hope to be able to thoroughly
analyze the behavior of the <a href="#qos">QoS</a> subsystems as well
as the behavior of all the intervening routers on the path.</p>
<p> Other TCP algorithms, such as TCP-Fit, are being evaluated.</p>
<p> To see what tcp algorithms are actually available:</p>
<pre>
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_allowed_congestion_control
</pre>
<p> If you wish to change the default TCP algorithm, you can do a:</p>
<pre>
echo the_algorithm_you_want > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congestion_control
</pre>
<P>There are <i>many</i> other parameters affecting TCP behavior,
notably (configured low) default limits on the amount of outstanding
data in flight, and the various congestion windows, that need also to
be modified to correctly emulate another machine's behavior on the
router. Merely changing the algorithm will not yield valid, comparable
results! TCP is very - almost chaotically - sensitive to initial
preconditions. </p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you capture your pre-existing sysctl
values, and your iptables and traffic shaping configurations before
doing a test.</p>
<P>Please see

pages</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="qos">Quality of Service (QoS) and Traffic shaping</h2>
<p>Good Quality of Service is a holy grail that has been chased over
the Internet for very long time. With the advent of streaming video
delivery, simultaneously with the increasing popularity of video
teleconferencing, and handheld, wireless devices, existing traffic
shaping methods, passive queue management and active queue management
systems no longer work as well as they did only a few years ago. </p>
<p>Fixing bufferbloat alone may only be part of an answer.</p>
<p>This router comes with QoS mechanisms enabled that are a combination
of HTB, HFSC, SFQ, and RED. Set properly, it works fairly well, but
new traffic shapers such as SFB and DRR have emerged that may
dramatically simplify QoS to where it could be a set and forget
operation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, "set and forget" is not now the case. CeroWrt QoS
needs to be set to the explicit up/download bandwidths available from
your provider, after running a sufficiently long duration test, longer
than that most online bandwidth tests run for.
<p>The onboard QoS system is easily disabled, and re-enabled for tests
of this sort. Also, as we are shipping nearly every available shaper
available, we hope that you will experiment with various forms of QoS
in order to get the best results for a multi-user and very mixed
workload - both out to the internet, and to your wireless devices, and
under good-to-difficult conditions. We hope at some point to have a
plug-able QoS system that 'just works', but we are a long way from
that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please experiment with what we've delivered today,
but be sure to set it correctly for your bandwidth! The default is
setup for a network that is 20Mbit down/4 Mbit up, which most likely isn't your configuration.</p>
<p>There are multiple other projects experimenting with forms of
QoS. This is a very active hotbed of research and development. </p>

QoS Behavior</a> for more up-to-date details.</p>

<h2 id="netem">Network Emulation</h2> 
<p>CeroWrt
includes the NETEM network emulator. With it, you can simulate delay,
packet loss, packet randomization, and many other factors that can
effect network connections. For more details about netem, please see
the
online <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/netem">documentation
on it's web site</a>.
<h2 id="netdrop">Net Drop Monitor</h2>
<p> Packet drops
occur throughout the network stack for a variety of reasons, many of
which are good, and more than a few, bad. To date, few have had any
insight into how,when,and why packet drop happens. The Packet drop
monitor (which requires a separate tool to use) can poke into the
depths of the kernel to determine this information.
