<h3>Mesh Networking</h3>
<p>Uberwrt comes with mesh networking enabled, using the babel protocol to spread routes over both ipv6 and ipv4. It uses ahcp to assign ipv4 and ipv6 addresses across the mesh. </p>
<p>Mesh networking provides a different experience than what you may be used to. It is quite unlike bridging. In particular, when used 'right' you are able to move transparently from one wireless (or wired!) node to another, relay traffic for others out of range of the main access point, and not lose your own connections. Mesh networks are self-repairing - at a sufficient densitity of nodes, there are always paths to get to get to your destination - and (unlike bridging), mesh routing is sensitive to the frequencies you are broadcasting on, so that if multiple wireless channels are in use, it tries to pick the clearest channels to transmit over.</p>

<p>For more details on how to set up a babel based mesh network using this router, please consult <a href=http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/uberwrt/Mesh>the mesh routing web page</a>.</p>
