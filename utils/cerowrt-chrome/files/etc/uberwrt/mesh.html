<h1>Mesh Networking</h1>

<p>CeroWrt comes with mesh networking enabled, using
the <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/babel/">Babel</a>
protocol (BabelZ) to spread routes over both <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6"><abbr
title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr></a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4"><abbr
title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr></a>.  It
uses <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/ahcp/"><abbr
title="Ad-Hoc Configuration Protocol">AHCP</abbr></a>
to assign IPv4 and IPv6 addresses across the mesh. </p>

<p>Mesh networking is quite unlike bridging or fixed access points. In
particular, when used 'right' you are able to move transparently from
one wireless (or wired!) node to another, relay traffic for others out
of range of the main access point, and not lose your own
connections. Mesh networks are self-repairing - at a sufficient
density of nodes, there are always paths to get to get to your
destination - and (unlike bridging), BabelZ's "diversity" mesh routing is sensitive to the
frequencies you are using, so that different network paths are picked based on the frequencies in use - a packet from a nearby 5.2GHz node will try to go through a node on another channel, while preferring ethernet wherever possible. Something like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">four colour theorem</a> applies to dense wireless networks.</p>

<p>Since there may be multiple hops before the wired connection each
with its own buffering, mesh networks are particularly sensitive to
bufferbloat and therefore a challenge as well as potentially very
useful in their own right.</p>

<p>Please consult
<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/uberwrt/wiki/Mesh">the mesh
routing web page</a> for more details on how to set up a Babel based
mesh network using this router.</p>
