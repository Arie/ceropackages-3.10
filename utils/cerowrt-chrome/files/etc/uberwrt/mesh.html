<h2>Mesh Networking</h2>

<p>UberWrt comes with mesh networking enabled, using
the <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/babel/">babel</a>
protocol to spread routes over both ipv6 and ipv4.  It
uses <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/ahcp/">ahcp</a>
to assign ipv4 and ipv6 addresses across the mesh. </p>

<p>Mesh networking is quite unlike bridging or fixed access points. In
particular, when used 'right' you are able to move transparently from
one wireless (or wired!) node to another, relay traffic for others out
of range of the main access point, and not lose your own
connections. Mesh networks are self-repairing - at a sufficient
densitity of nodes, there are always paths to get to get to your
destination - and (unlike bridging), mesh routing is sensitive to the
frequencies you are using, so that if multiple wireless
channels are in use, it tries to pick the clearest channels to
transmit over.</p>

<p>Since there may be multiple hops before the wired connection each
with its own buffering, mesh networks are particularly sensitive to
bufferbloat and therefore a challenge as well as potentially very
useful.</p>

<p>Please consult
<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/uberwrt/Mesh">the mesh
routing web page</a> for more details on how to set up a babel based
mesh network using this router..</p>
