<h1>About UberWrt</h1> 

<p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/uberwrt">UberWrt</a>
is a family of projects intended to resolve endemic problems in
networking today, and push the state of the art of edge networks and
routers forward. Projects include tighter
integration with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">
<abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>
(<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/iscwrt">ISCWrt</a>),
wireless mesh networking
(<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/wisp6">Wisp6</a>),
measurements of networking and censorship issues
(<a href="http://projectbismark.net"><abbr
title="Broadband Internet Service BenchMARK">BISMark</abbr></a>), and
others.</p>

<p>It is closely related to the ongoing debloat-testing efforts of
<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net">Bufferbloat.net</a> except that
debloat-testing targets servers and laptops, not routers, directly,
and UberWrt does not, at present, include the eBDP algorithm.</p>

<h2>About CeroWrt</h2> 

<p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net">CeroWrt</a> is
an <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">OpenWrt</a> based routing and
simulation platform intended for use by individuals, network engineers,
researchers, teachers, and students interested in
advancing the state of the art on the Internet, and in particular,
those investigating the problems of latency under load, bufferbloat,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">wireless-n</a>, and
the inter-relationships between various <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><abbr
title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr></a> & <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service"><abbr
title="Quality of Service">QoS</abbr></a> algorithms.</p>

<p>A core goal for CeroWrt is to provide a well understood platform,
where contributors will be able to eventually perform tests with
confidence that their results can be duplicated by others.</p>

<p>CeroWrt is a base for most of the other UberWrt projects.  The default build
is too big (~9MB) to be compatible with more commonly available routers.</p>

<p>CeroWrt breaks with home router conventions in several ways.  The
first you are already seeing - it comes with
an <a href="webserver.html">integral web server</a> with which you can
establish local web services.  This is useful, for example, in
providing a place where you can share data such as packet captures
with others in your team, and a place to keep useful information when
the Internet is down. </p>

<p>There are other <a href="features.html">features</a> all intended
to help make insight into networking problems easier. In particular,
bufferbloat, wherever <a href="debloat.html">we could find it</a>, has
been reduced tremendously, but not eliminated entirely, which is our
eventual goal.</p>

<p>While we have tried very hard to produce a usable web interface for
the normal use of CeroWrt as your primary Internet router (and do
desire you use it as such and give us feedback!), some things, such as
configuration of the <a href="proxy.html">web proxy</a>,
or <A href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/uberwrt/wiki/Using_Alternate_TCP_algorithms">alternate
TCP algorithms</a> can require non-<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"><abbr
title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr></a> editing via <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><abbr
title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>As this is a research and development platform, there will be no
long term support for this release. Subsequent releases will likely
require a complete reflashing and reconfiguration of your router. We
apologize for the inconvenience but the state of the art and the
problems we are trying to solve are rapidly moving targets that we
must track closely. We will feed back the results of this work into
stable distributions.</p>

<p>Thanks for giving CeroWrt a
try!</p> <p>Please <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/account/register">register
on and use our wikis</a>, join
the <a href="https://lists.bufferbloat.net">mailing lists</a>, and
share your results.</p>

<p>The network you save may be your own.</p>
