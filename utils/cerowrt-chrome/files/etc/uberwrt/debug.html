<h2>Debugging and diagnostic tools</h2>
<p>Most home routers shipped to date have very primitive, or absent
network testing and debugging tools. CeroWrt comes with a rich set of
such, some critical ones are installed by default, and many more
available in the package repository.</p>

<h3>Default Packages</h3>
<ul>tcpdump,traceroute,ping,ping6,FIXME</ul>
<h3>Optional Packages</h3>
<p>These include, but are not limited to:
<ul>iperf,lft,netperf,httpping,bing,FIXME</ul>
</p>

<p>Update and review the package listing in the router's
administrative interface for a complete listing.</p>

<p> The cerowrt-dbg releases also contain oprofile support, which is
very useful for trying to see problems integral to the kernel itself
and networking stack. Due to the "heisenbugging" performance impact of
oprofile, however, it is not available in the primary releases of
CeroWrt.</p>
