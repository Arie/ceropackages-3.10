<h2>The Web Server</h2>
<p>
The router includes a high performance
webserver <a href="http://lighttpd.net">lighttpd</a>, known as
"lighty" which, if additional storage is provided on the USB port of
the router, which you can use to provide public facing web services.
</p>
<p>
You can use this web server to publish your own static content which
can be available all the time, rather than just when your home
computers are powered up.  Lighty supports CGI, so more ambitious web
applications are possible within the limits of what is available in OpenWRT; the
usual security issues apply. We may look into a simple content
management system someday...
