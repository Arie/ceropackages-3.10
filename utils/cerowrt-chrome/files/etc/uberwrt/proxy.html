<h1>Web Proxy</h1>

<p>CeroWrt provides <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/">polipo</a>, which is a caching web proxy server.</p>

<p>Proxying is an integral component of the http architecture,
commonly used in institutional environments behind firewalls but
seldom used in home environments, despite easy to configure automatic
mechanisms for configuration (wpad and proxy.pac), and nearly
universal support in all modern equipment and browsers. Due to the
lossy nature of wireless, proxying theoretically has native advantages
- each proxied connection consists of two (or more) 'split TCP'
streams, which can ramp up and down independently of packet loss -
smoothing out bandwidth on both sides of the bottleneck to the
internet. </p>

<p>As presently configured in CeroWrt, a polipo'd connection competes
poorly with non-proxied streams, in general only being a win where it
has local cache and/or can convert connections into using HTTP/1.1
pipelining.  The router defaults
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Westwood_plus">TCP
Westwood plus</a> which attempts to be bandwidth friendly, and most
clients use a TCP that is more aggressive, so proxied connections can
end up starved for bandwidth vs direct connections. </p>

<p>There are multiple solutions to this problem - making your web
clients use the proxy is probably the best of them, which leverages
the advantages of Westwood + for wireless. Another option is to enable
TCP cubic on the router (not recommended, except for testing), and a
third, to apply a different level of QoS to proxied streams than
non-proxied, which is the approach being followed by the ongoing
Diffserv work elsewhere. </p>

<p>It is reasonably effective to merely put your highest bandwidth
streams (e.g. Video) through the proxy. As these devices tend not to
move, you'll only have to configure them once, in order to gain the
benefits of proxying elsewhere on your network.</p>

<p> The GUI interface for polipo is reasonably complete. All you need
to do to turn it on via the gui is allow in your private networks
(including IPv6!), and if you attach a USB stick as a local cache,
point it at the location you plan to be caching in, then configure
your devices to access it on port 8123. While enabling automatic wpad
and proxy.pac configuration is feasible with the integral web server
there are security implications we have not yet addressed. (please see
the wiki for updates)</p>

<P>An ad-blocking and experimental web proxy,
'<a href="http://www.privoxy.org/">privoxy</a>', is also in the
package repository for CeroWrt. It works well to provide ad blocking
facilities to devices lacking them, particularly of use in bandwidth
scarce locations such as the developing world.</p>

<p>Polipo can act as an effective IPv6 to IPv4 translator. You can
enable your browser to run the proxy over IPv6 and nearly eliminate
your usage of ipv4 for most operations.</p>
