<h1>About IPv6</h1>

<p>All <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4"><abbr
title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr></a> address space was allocated to regional authorities by
March, 2011, and exhaustion of these allocations looms. When
exhaustion occurs, there will be no room left for further expansion of
the Internet, and/or increasingly problematic uses of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"><abbr
title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr></a>, with
application failures increasing with time.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6"><abbr
title="Internet Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr></a> has existed for a
long time, but has not been widely deployed in home routers, and since
usage has been low, networks may have latent problems that need to be
fixed to enable a seamless transition to IPv6.  Recent trials of IPv6,
including <a href="http://www.worldipv6day.org/">World IPv6 Day</a>,
have shown that IPv6 transition is feasible and desirable.</p>

<p>CeroWrt has IPv6 (specifically <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4">6to4</a>) networking
enabled by default. If the router has a public IPv4 address, 6to4 will
be enabled on startup, and all your local networks supplied with a
usable IPv6 address range. 6to4 is working well on some networks in
America, notably
<a href="http://www.comcast6.net/6to4-config.php">Comcast</a>, on which
geographically dispersed production 6to4 relays have been installed,
and much of Europe, but may be (possibly very) problematic in parts of the world
unserved by local 6to4 relays.</p>

<p>IPv6 can be easily
disabled or modified via the router's networking screen, on the 'v6'
option, but please try to report bugs and expend the effort needed to
actually use it. The future of the Internet is at stake!</p>
