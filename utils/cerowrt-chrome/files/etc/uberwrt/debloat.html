<h1>Debloating</h1>
<h2>Bufferbloat</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/attachments/27/IC-15-03-Backspace.pdf">Bufferbloat
is a widespread problem</a> present throughout the Internet,
"end-to-end." Debloating is a "work in progress" industry wide and
will take years.  Ultimately, all buffering/queing in operating
systems needs to be carefully managed and
be <a href="http://gettys.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/rant-warning-there-is-no-single-right-answer-for-buffering-ever/">automatically
adaptive</a> to the data transfer rates. All network routers (and
operating systems!) should be running with AQM (e.g. algorithms such
as RED) including home routers: unfortunately, existing algorithms such as RED
are <a href="http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/red-in-a-different-light/">unlikely to work correctly</a> in today's home network environment.</p><p>
UberWrt/CeroWrt is the test platform for improved AQM
algorithms. To achieve ultimate latencies under load across the high
bandwidth variation of 802.11 and broadband, new AQM algorithms need
testing in addition to more complex changes in internal buffering;
these will take time and therefore debloating will be a work in
progress for an extended period.
</p>

<p>
In the upstream direction, the bottleneck link may be adjacent to your
home devices (e.g. your laptop on wireless), and in your operating
system, outside of our control; you may see problems therefore copying
from your home device upstream to the internet and/or your home file
server.  Unfortunately, TCP acks can be stalled behind packets queued
in a particular direction, so bufferbloat in one direction <b>can</b>
result in bad performance (poor latency) in the other direction.  If
you run Linux, you can help with debloating by working with those
working on
the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/429943/">debloat-testing</a> work
going on on <a href="http://bufferbloat.net">bufferbloat.net</a>.  On
other operating systems, you should contact your operating system
vendor and complain. Be gentle (but insistent), however: before 2011,
bufferbloat was not understood to be a general problem, and it will
take time to overcome.
</p>

<p>
Note that bufferbloat only occurs in the device just before the
bottleneck in a path. A common strategy when fixes for bufferbloat are
not available for the devices either side of a bottleneck, therefore,
is to try to arrange to move the bottleneck from a device which is
badly bloated to one which is not: e.g. you might arrange to ensure
that your wireless bandwidth is <b>always</b> bigger than your
broadband bandwidth (and using bandwidth shaping and QoS to avoid the
consequences of bufferbloat in that hop as best you can).
</p>

<h2>Home Routers</h2>
<p>
Current operating systems has been tuned over the last decade for
maximum bandwidth over very long, high bandwidth LFN ("Large Fat
Network") paths without consideration of bufferbloat (gigabit speed +
over 100ms or longer paths). </p> 
<p>The quest for "land speed" record bragging rights has destroyed latency, the speed we really need.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">bandwidth-delay
product</a> of these LFN paths is very high indeed, and buffers have
been adjusted upwards accordingly. When these same operating systems are
used in home routers (e.g. Linux and Apple's system), LFN tuning 
becomes a serious headache as the circumstances differ tremendously.
</p>

<p>
Home routers never operate in LFN's, rather, they operate in two
network environments, sometimes simultaneously:
<ol>
<li>Relatively low bandwidth (100Mbps or much less), sometimes long paths (10-100ms), (your broadband connection) and
<li>Medium bandwidth (never much more than 100Mbps wireless, and never
more than 1Gps wired), but very, very short paths (in your house, to
other devices such as file storage, less than 1ms away).
</ol>
<p>
We can therefore cut the buffering in the router greatly, since there
are never high bandwidth, high delay paths through these devices. If
we've done this correctly, you'll never see lower bandwidth, but will
see much better latency. Please let us know if you see any performance
problems.
</p>

<p>Debloating techniques currently in place include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vastly reduced TXQUEUELEN across all ethernet and wireless interfaces.</li>
<li>Reduced buffering in the ethernet switch</li>
<li>Reduced driver buffering across all ethernet and wireless interfaces</li>
<li>QoS enabled by default</li>
</ul>

<p>
QoS classification is interesting to improve low latency applications
(e.g. VOIP & gaming) and to help with the reverse path consequences of
bufferbloat (e.g. delay of acks, DNS and other key protocols which are
killing performance and even inducing failures).  QoS is a useful but
insufficient tool: bufferbloat cannot be completely solved without AQM,
a common misunderstanding.
