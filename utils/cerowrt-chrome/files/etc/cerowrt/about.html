<h1>About CeroWrt</h1> 

<p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt">CeroWrt</a>
is a project to resolve endemic problems in home
networking today, and push the state of the art of edge networks and
routers forward. Projects include tighter
integration with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions">
<abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>,
wireless mesh networking
(<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/wisp6">Wisp6</a>),
measurements of networking and censorship issues
(<a href="http://projectbismark.net"><abbr
title="Broadband Internet Service BenchMARK">BISMark</abbr></a>), and
others.</p>

<p>It is closely related to the ongoing debloat-testing efforts of
<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net">Bufferbloat.net</a> except that
debloat-testing targets servers and laptops, not routers, directly,
and CeroWrt does not, at present, include the eBDP algorithm.</p>

<h2>CeroWrt's Goals</h2> 

<p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net">CeroWrt</a> is
a build of the <a href="http://www.openwrt.org">OpenWrt</a> routing
platform intended for use by individuals, network engineers,
researchers, teachers, and students interested in
advancing the state of the art on the Internet, and in particular,
those investigating the problems of latency under load, bufferbloat,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">wireless-n</a>, and
the inter-relationships between various <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><abbr
title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr></a> & <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service"><abbr
title="Quality of Service">QoS</abbr></a> algorithms.</p>

<p>CeroWrt breaks with home router conventions in several ways.  The
first you are already seeing - it comes with a high
performance <a href="webserver.html">integral web server</a> with
which you can establish local web services and provide web content and
services 24x7.</p>

<p>First class name services become a necessity rather than a "nice to
have" with IPv6 deployment. Manual configuration of name services with
IPv4 and IPv6 literal addresses is no longer feasible by most people,
if indeed it ever was.  Toward the goal of "plug and play" home
environment able to publish IPv6 addresses into the
global Internet name space without manual configuraton, CeroWrt
includes the Bind name server. Security in the home environment is
also a goal, ergo CeroWrt's support for DNSSEC using ISC Bind in a
chrooted jail.
</p>

<p>A core goal for CeroWrt is to provide a well understood platform,
where contributors can perform tests with
confidence that their results can be duplicated by others.</p>

<p>CeroWrt is the base on which other specialised builds may be built
in the future. The default build is too big (~9MB) to be compatible
with more commonly available routers.</p>

<p>There are other <a href="features.html">features</a> all intended
to help make insight into networking problems easier. In particular,
bufferbloat, wherever <a href="debloat.html">we could find it</a>, has
been reduced, but not yet eliminated entirely; that requires the research
in AQM and buffer management for which CeroWrt is intended.</p>

<p>While we have tried very hard to produce a usable web interface for
the normal use of CeroWrt as your primary Internet router (and do
desire you use it as such and give us feedback!), some things, such as
configuration of the <a href="proxy.html">web proxy</a>,
or <A href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Using_Alternate_TCP_algorithms">alternate
TCP algorithms</a> can require non-<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"><abbr
title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr></a> editing via <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><abbr
title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>As this is a research and development platform, there will be no
long term support for this release and will likely
require a complete reflashing and reconfiguration of your router. We
apologize for the inconvenience but the state of the art and the
problems we are trying to solve are rapidly moving targets that we
must track closely. We will feed back the results of this work into
stable distributions.</p>

<p>Thanks for giving CeroWrt a
try!</p> <p>Please <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/account/register">register
on and use our wikis</a>, join
the <a href="https://lists.bufferbloat.net">mailing lists</a>, and
share your results.</p>

<p>The network you save may be your own.</p>
