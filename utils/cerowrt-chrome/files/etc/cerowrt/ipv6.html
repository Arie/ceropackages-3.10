    <h1>About IPv6</h1>

    <p>All <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">
        <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4">IPv4</abbr></a> address space
      was allocated to regional authorities by March, 2011, and exhaustion of
      these allocations looms. When exhaustion occurs, there will be no room
      left for further expansion of the Internet, and/or increasingly
      problematic uses
      of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">
        <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr></a>, with
      application failures increasing with
      time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6"><abbr title="Internet
      Protocol version 6">IPv6</abbr></a> has existed for a long time, but has
      not been widely deployed in home routers, and since usage has been low,
      networks may have latent problems that need to be fixed to enable a
      seamless transition to IPv6. Recent experience with IPv6, especially
      since <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org//">World IPv6 Launch</a> in
      June 2012, have shown that IPv6 transition is feasible, desirable, and
      growing.</p>

    <p>CeroWrt has IPv6 networking enabled by default. If the router receives
      and IPv6 prefix by DHCP prefix delegation on startup, all your local
      networks will be automatically supplied with a usable IPv6 address
      range.</p>

    <p>Even if your provider does not support IPv6 natively, it is
      straightforward to configure CeroWrt to give global IPv6 addresses using
      6to4 or 6in4 networking. The wiki gives instructions for configuring a
      <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/IPv6_Tunnel">
        free 6in4 tunnel through Hurricane Electric.</a></p>

    <p>IPv6 can be easily disabled or modified via the router's networking
      screen, on the 'v6' option, but please try to report bugs and expend the
      effort needed to actually use it. The future of the Internet is at
      stake!</p>
