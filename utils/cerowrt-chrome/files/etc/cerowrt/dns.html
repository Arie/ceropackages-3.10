    <h1>DNS Server</h1>
    <p>The goal is secure, autoconfigured name services: a home user should be
      able to plug in a new named device, and everything "just work", including
      publishing an IPv6 address into the global DNS without any configuration
      required.</p>

    <p>
      Towards the stated goal, the router
      includes <a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">dnsmasq.</a>
      Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
      It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
      It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
      DNS.</p>

    <h2>DNSSEC support is coming</h2>
    <p>dnsmasq does not currently support
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnssec">DNSSEC (Domain Name System
        Security Extensions)</a>, a method for adding authentication and data
        security to the existing Domain Name System (DNS) while retaining
        backward compatibility with systems that do not support DNSSEC. This is
        actively in development by the dnsmasq team, and it will be incorporated
        into CeroWrt as soon as it is available.</p>

    <p>
      A DNSSEC-enabled name server provides authoritative data for a given
      domain responds to requests with the requested data and also a signature
      record which cryptographically authenticates the response.</p>

    <p>
      A DNSSEC-enabled name server that provides local resolution of DNS
      requests validates the signatures received from authoritative servers to
      ensure that the data received was not tampered with. If the data in the
      response cannot be proven to be valid and secure, the name server will
      reject it and return a "server failed" message to the client.</p>

    <h2>Local DNS Addressing</h2>
    <p>The CeroWrt router is always available to its LAN interfaces as
      'gw.home.lan' and "cerowrt.local". This makes it easy to connect with the router without requiring you to know the IP address ranges used by the router.</p>

    <h2>mDNS Addressing</h2> <a name="mdns"></a>
    <p>By default, CeroWrt has
      a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDNS">multicast DNS</a> (aka
      "Zeroconfig" or "Bonjour" naming) reflector
      (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)">Avahi
      package</a>) enabled for all the LAN interfaces. This allows you to locate
      devices without knowing their IP addresses.</p>
