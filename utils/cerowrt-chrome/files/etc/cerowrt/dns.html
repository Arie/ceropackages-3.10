<h1>DNS Server</h1>
<p>The goal is secure, autoconfigured name services: a home user
should be able to plug in a new named device, and everything "just
work", including publishing an IPv6 address into the global DNS
without any configuration required.
<h2>Automatic configuration & security</h2>
<p>Towards the stated goal, the router
includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND">Bind 9</a>
running in a <a href="chrooted jail">chrooted jail</a>
for additional security. This enables the router to support advanced name services, including zone transfers, split views, and DNSSEC. For more
details, <a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/OCEAN_CITY_RELEASE_NOTES">see the release notes</a> 
as not all of this intended functionality is complete.

<h2>DNSSEC support</h2>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnssec">DNSSEC 
(Domain Name System Security Extensions)</a> is a method for adding
authentication and data security to the existing Domain Name System (DNS)
while retaining backward compatibility with systems that do not support
DNSSEC.
<p>
A DNSSEC-enabled name server which provides authoritative data for a
given domain responds to requests with the requested data and also a
signature record which cryptographically authenticates the response.
<p>
A DNSSEC-enabled name server that provides local resolution of DNS
requests validates the signatures received from authoritative servers
to ensure that the data received was not tampered with.  If the data
in the response cannot be proven to be valid and secure, the name server
will reject it and return a "server failed" message to the client.
