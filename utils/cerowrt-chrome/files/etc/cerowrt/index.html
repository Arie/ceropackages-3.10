    <h1>Welcome to CeroWrt</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt">CeroWrt</a> is a
      project to resolve endemic problems in home networking today, and to push
      the state of the art of edge networks and routers forward.</p>

    <h2>CeroWrt's Goals</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/">CeroWrt</a> is a build of
      the <a href="https://www.openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a> routing platform intended
      for use by individuals, network engineers, researchers, teachers, and
      students interested in advancing the state of the art on the Internet, and
      in particular, those investigating the problems of latency under load,
      bufferbloat, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">wireless-n</a>,
      and the interrelationships between
      various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><abbr title="Transmission
      Control
      Protocol">TCP</abbr></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Queue_Management"><abbr title="Active
      Queue Management">AQM</abbr></a>, and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">
        <abbr title="Quality of Service">QoS</abbr></a> algorithms.</p>

    <p>There are other <a href="features.html">features</a> all intended to help
      make insight into networking problems easier. In particular, this release
      dramatically <a href="debloat.html">reduces bufferbloat</a> for the wired
      interfaces. The effect of latency under load for wireless interfaces has
      been reduced, but not yet eliminated entirely; that requires more research
      in AQM and buffer management for which CeroWrt is intended.</p>

    <p>CeroWrt breaks with home router conventions in several ways. The first
      you are already seeing - it comes with a high
      performance <a href="webserver.html">integral web server</a> with which
      you can establish local web services and provide web content and services
      24x7.</p>

    <p>First class name services become a necessity rather than a "nice to have"
      with IPv6 deployment. Manual configuration of name services with IPv4 and
      IPv6 literal addresses is no longer feasible by most people, if indeed it
      ever was. Toward the goal of "plug and play" home environment able to
      publish IPv6 addresses into the global Internet name space without manual
      configuration, CeroWrt includes the latest dnsmasq name server. Better security
      in the home environment is also a goal, the version of dnsmasq has support for
      DNSSEC. </p>

    <p>A core goal for CeroWrt is to provide a well understood platform, where
      contributors can perform tests with confidence that their results can be
      duplicated by others.</p>

    <p>CeroWrt is the base on which other specialised builds may be built in the
      future. The default build is too big (~9MB) to be compatible with more
      commonly available routers.</p>

    <p>While we have tried very hard to produce a usable web interface for the
      normal use of CeroWrt as your primary Internet router (and do desire you
      use it as such and give us feedback!), some things can require
      non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"><abbr title="Graphical
      User Interface">GUI</abbr></a> editing
      via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><abbr title="Secure
      Shell">SSH</abbr></a>.</p>

    <p>
      CeroWrt is currently aimed at a single hardware platform for which fully
      open drivers are available: the Netgear WNDR3700v2 and WNDR3800 routers.
      These are current 802.11abgn routers using the Atheros AR7161 rev 2 with
      gigabit Ethernet ports. They have a capable processor and 16Mbytes of
      flash and 64MBytes of RAM (the WNDR3800 has 128MBytes) to provide
      sufficient space for functionality needed in a home router today. The
      WNDR3700v3 and v4 models that have recently appeared on the market does
      not work with CeroWrt; purchase the WNDR3800 if you want to be
      future-proof.</p>

    <p>CeroWrt is based on the <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWrt router</a>
      platform. Since CeroWrt is a research and development platform, there will
      be no long term support for this release. Using it will likely require a
      complete reflashing and reconfiguration of your router. We apologise for
      the inconvenience but the state of the art and the problems we are trying
      to solve are rapidly moving targets that we must track closely. We
      regularly feed back the results of this work into the stable OpenWrt
      distributions, so this work will become mainstream more rapidly.</p>

    <p>Thanks for giving CeroWrt a try! The network you save may be your
    own.</p>
