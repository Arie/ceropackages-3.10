    <h1>Debloating</h1>
    <h2>Bufferbloat</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/attachments/27/IC-15-03-Backspace.pdf">Bufferbloat
        is a widespread problem</a> present throughout the Internet,
        "end-to-end." Debloating is a "work in progress" industry wide and will
        take years. Ultimately, all buffering/queuing in operating systems needs
        to be carefully managed and
        be <a href="http://gettys.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/low-latency-requires-smart-queuing-traditional-aqm-is-not-enough/">
        automatically adaptive</a> to the data transfer rates. All network
        routers (and operating systems!) should be running
        with better <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aqm/charter/">Packet Scheduling"> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_queue_management"><abbr title="Active
        Queue Management">AQM</abbr></a> including home routers (<a href="http://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt/wiki/Smart_Queue_Management"><abbr title="Smart Queue Management">SQM</abbr></a>). Unfortunately,
        existing algorithms such
        as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_early_detection"><abbr title="Random
        Early Detection">RED</abbr></a> are difficult to tune,
        and <a href="http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/red-in-a-different-light/">unlikely
        to work correctly</a>. Worse, those algorithms can make performance much
        worse if not tuned properly. Consequently, many network operators never
        used these techniques at all.</p>

    <p>
      CeroWrt is the test platform for improved SQM algorithms. To achieve
      ultimate latencies under load across the high bandwidth variation of
      802.11 and broadband, new SQM algorithms need testing in addition to more
      complex changes in internal buffering; these will take time and therefore
      debloating will be a work in progress for an extended period.</p>

    <p>
      In the upstream direction, the bottleneck link may be adjacent to your
      home devices (e.g. your laptop on wireless), and in your operating system,
      outside of our control; you may see problems therefore copying from your
      home device upstream to the Internet and/or your home file server.
      Unfortunately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><abbr title="Transmission
      Control Protocol">TCP</abbr></a> acks can be stalled behind packets queued
      in a particular direction, so bufferbloat in one direction <b>can</b>
      result in bad performance (poor latency) in the other direction. If you
      run Linux, you can help with debloating by working with those working on
      the work
      going on at <a href="http://bufferbloat.net">bufferbloat.net</a>. On other
      operating systems, you should contact your operating system vendor and
      complain. Be gentle (but insistent), however: before 2011, bufferbloat was
      not understood to be a general problem, and it will take time to
      overcome.</p>

    <p>
      Note that bufferbloat only occurs in the device just before the bottleneck
      in a path. A common strategy when fixes for bufferbloat are not available
      for the devices either side of a bottleneck, therefore, is to try to
      arrange to move the bottleneck from a device which is badly bloated to one
      which is not: e.g. you might arrange to ensure that your wireless
      bandwidth is <b>always</b> bigger than your broadband bandwidth (and using
      bandwidth shaping
      and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service"><abbr title="Quality
      of Service">QoS</abbr></a> to avoid the consequences of bufferbloat in
      that hop as best you can). We have found, however, that many QoS systems
      are badly broken as they do not also do SQM.</p>

    <h2>Home Routers</h2>
    <p>
      Current operating systems has been tuned over the last decade for maximum
      bandwidth over very long, high bandwidth LFN ("Large Fat Network") paths
      without consideration of bufferbloat (gigabit speed + over 100ms or longer
      paths). </p>

    <p>The quest for "land speed" record bragging rights has destroyed latency,
      the speed we really need.
      The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">
      bandwidth-delay product <abbr title="Bandwidth-Delay
      Product">(BDP)</abbr></a> of these LFN paths is very high indeed, and
      buffers have been adjusted upwards accordingly. When these same operating
      systems are used in home routers (e.g. Linux and Apple's system), LFN
      tuning becomes a serious headache as the circumstances differ
      tremendously.</p>

    <p>
      Home routers never operate in LFN's, rather, they operate in two network
      environments, sometimes simultaneously:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Relatively low bandwidth (100Mbps or much less), sometimes long paths
        (10-100ms), (your broadband connection) and</li>
      <li>Medium bandwidth (never much more than 100Mbps wireless, and never
        more than 1Gbps wired), but very, very short paths (in your house, to
        other devices such as file storage, less than 1ms away).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We can now manage the buffering in the router better now, since there are
      never high bandwidth, high delay paths through these devices. If we've
      done this correctly, you'll never see lower bandwidth, but will see much
      better latency. Please let us know if you see any performance
      problems.</p>

    <h2>Debloating in CeroWrt</h2>
    <p>
      In mid-2012, Kathy Nichols and Van Jacobson devised the CoDel
      ("controlled delay") algorithm for minimizing the delay of packets in
      queues waiting to be sent. Their initial work has been validated
      theoretically as well as by implementations in CeroWrt. The algorithm, and
      the combination with "Flow queueing" - fq_codel - as implemented by Eric Dumazet has also been incorporated
      into recent Linux kernels, where it is can be used as the default queue
      discipline.</p>

    <p>
      fq_codel has nearly eliminated bufferbloat for all wired interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>

      Wireless interfaces have a more complicated queueing structure, with
      packet aggregation that can confuse the CoDel algorithms. Although CeroWrt
      dramatically improves latency for wireless interfaces, more research is
      necessary for further improvements on wireless links.</p>

    <p>Cerowrt also contains an implementation of the AQM <abbr title="Pi Integral Enhanced">PIE</abbr>,
       which is the upcoming standard in DOCSIS 3.1</p>
